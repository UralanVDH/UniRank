## Welcome to UniRank

UniRank allows users such as universities and colleges to quickly assess a common admissions criterium: the ranking of an applicant's alma mater.

### How does it work?

UniRank automatically extracts university and college names from a file or search term and matches it to our database of national, regional and global rankings.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/UralanVDH/UniRank/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
